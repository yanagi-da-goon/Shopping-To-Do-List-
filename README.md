# Shopping-To-Do-List-

A program for a shopping list where the user gets to choose what they want to do with the list. The user gets to choose from 8 different options, varying from adding to the list to clearing the entire list. There will be instructions in the terminal to help guide the user with their choices. For most of the input asked for the user, it will be with integer/number. With the exception of option 1, 3, 4, where 3 and 4 have to be exactly the same as from the original. Same capitalization.
